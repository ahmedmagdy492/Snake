the player model:
a small orange triangle that is made up of pixels

player directions:
-if the player go left or right beyond the screen the player will teleported to the other end of the screen with the same y value but x will be reset to be either 0 or WindowWidth.
-if the player tries to go beyond the screen in any y direction (up/down) he will be collided therefore lose the game

1.spawn the apple in a random position within the window limit
2.spwan the player in the middle of the game screen
3.once the user hits one of the arrow keys the player will move in that direction:
  -when the player moves in a direction the whole player model has to be totally rotated
4.if the user hits the apple a point will be added to his score
5.after 10 seconds the apple will be removed and spawned in a totally different spot (calculated randomly as well)
6.if the player hits itself he will lose
7.if the player hits the upper or bottom walls he will also lose


Pixel:
-Vector2(x,y)
-Color
-Pixel Width, Height

Player:
-Array of Pixel
-Speed
-Current Direction
-Is Moving
-Width, Height

How to Render it:
iterate over the buffer that contains the pixels and draw them with their positions onto the screen

How to Move it(Direction):
multiply the speed by either 1 or -1 and add the speed to either x or y of each pixel depending on the pressed arrow key
